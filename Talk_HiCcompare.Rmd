## The 3D structure of the genome

- Human genome is big - ~3.2 billion base pairs
- ~2 meters (~6ft) of DNA in one cell are packed into the $\sim10\mu m$ nucleus
- ~500 times distance from Earth to Sun in all cells from human body

## Chromosome conformation capture technologies

The core strategy in 3D genome mapping is nuclear **proximity ligation** (Cullen et al., 1993), which allows detection of distant genomic segments residing in close spatial proximity to one another, yet are linearly far away.

## Hi-C Data as a matrix

.pull-left[
- The genome (chromosome) is split into equally sized regions
- Data is represented by a symmetric matrix of contacts $C_{ij}$ where entry $ij$ corresponds to the number of times region $i$ comes into contact with region $j$
- Off-diagonal data view - increasing **distance** between interacting regions
- Power-law decay of interactions with increasing **distance**

## Biases in Hi-C data

- Hi-C data suffers from many biases: **sequence-driven** (e.g., mappability, CG content) & **technology-driven** (e.g., type of restriction enzyme, sequencing platform)

- Most normalization methods work only on individual Hi-C dataset, one at a time

- Individual normalization methods do not perform well when the goal is comparison

## Joint Normalization on the MD plot

.pull-left[
- **MD plot** represents data from two Hi-C matrices on one plot

- Similar to the MA plot (Bland-Altman plot)

- Y-axis: **M**ean differences in interaction frequencies = log2(IF2/IF1)

- X-axis: Genomic **D**istance

## Cyclic loess normalization of multiple Hi-C datasets

Cyclic loess (Ballman et al. 2004) - take each pair of datasets, normalize, repeat until convergence

1. Choose two out of the N total samples then generate an MD plot
2. Fit a loess curve f(d) to the MD plot
3. Subtract f(d)/2 from the first dataset and add f(d)/2 to the second
4. Repeat until all unique pairs have been compared
5. Repeat until convergence

## Distance-centric chromatin interaction difference detection

## Distance-centric chromatin interaction difference detection 

- **Exact test**
    - For comparing 2 groups without other covariates
    - Similar to Fisher's exact test

- **GLM Methods**
    - For more complex experiments utilize the GLM framework
    - The vector of covariates $x_i$ can be linked with  $\mu_{dgj}$ through a log-linear model $log(\mu_{dgj}) = x_i^T\beta_{dg} + log(M_{dj})$

- Implemented in [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/edgeR/) R package

## Interpretation of differentially interacting chromatin regions (DIRs)

- **Visualization of DIRs.** A Manhattan-like plot of DIRs may inform us about abnormalities or reveal chromosome site-specific enrichment of differentially interacting regions

- **Overlap between differentially expressed genes and DIRs.** If gene expression measurements are available, differentially expressed genes may be tested for overlap with DIRs - test the link between DIRs and changed gene expression

- **Functional enrichment of genes overlapping DIRs.** DIRs may disrupt specific pathways/functions - test whether genes overlapping DIRs are enriched in a canonical pathway or share a common function
---

## Interpretation of differentially interacting chromatin regions (DIRs)

- **Overlap enrichment between TAD boundaries and DIRs.** DIRs may correspond to TAD boundaries that are deleted or created - test DIRs for significant overlap with TAD boundaries detected in either condition or only in boundaries changed between the conditions

- **Overlap between DIRs and binding sites.** DIRs may correspond to locations where proteins bind with DNA, such as CTCF sites - test for overlap between binding site locations and DIRs.
---

## Summary

- **Distance-centric view** of Hi-C data is critical (`MD plot`)

- **Joint loess normalization** effectively removes between-dataset biases (`HiCcompare`, https://bioconductor.org/packages/HiCcompare/)

- **Differential analysis considering distance** has optimal performance (`multiHiCcompare`, https://bioconductor.org/packages/multiHiCcompare/)
